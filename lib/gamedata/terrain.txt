# File: terrain.txt


# This file is used to initialize the "terrain feature" information for 
# the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# Note that, unlike other edit files, modifying this file casually is likely
# to be a BAD IDEA (unless you intend to make actual programming changes)
# for two reasons:

#   1. Terrain features do not appear unless there is specific code in the
#   level generation algorithms to include them, so adding new terrain
#   features to this file will by itself have no effect.

#   2. The game uses the names of the standard terrain features
#   ("granite wall", etc) in terrain placement.  Changing the name of a terrain
#   feature can thus stop the game from running; changing its properties will
#   change game behaviour; and any changes during the playing of an individual
#   game are likely to mess it up.

# Note that terrain feature zero contains the "darkness" picture.

# === Understanding terrain.txt ===

# name : serial number : terrain name
# graphics : symbol : color
# mimic : feature to mimic
# priority : display priority on mini-map
# flags : terrain flags
# info : shop number : digging
# walk-msg: warning message - walking
# run-msg: warning message - running
# hurt-msg: damage message
# die-msg: death message
# confused-msg: message for confused monster move into non-passable terrain
# look-prefix: used before the name in the result from looking
# look-in-preposition: preposition used when looking at one's own position
# resist-flag: monster race flag for resist

# 'name' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new feature.

# 'graphics' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are 27 colors:

# D - Dark Gray    w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
# r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Umber
# W - Light Gray   P - Light Purple   y - Yellow        R - Light Red
# G - Light Green  B - Light Blue     U - Light Umber   p - Purple
# v - Violet       t - Teal           m - Mud           Y - Light Yellow
# i - Magenta-Pink T - Light Teal     V - Light Violet  I - Light Pink
# M - Mustard      z - Blue Slate     Z - Deep Light Blue

# 'mimic' is the index of a feature to mimic; some features look like another
# feature until they are discovered by the player.

# 'priority' is for display priority on the minimap, where only a selection
# of grids are chosen.  This enables the minimap to display the information
# most likely to be useful to the player.

# 'flags' is for terrain flags.

# 'info' is for other terrain information;  Shop number is the index of the
# shop if the terrain is a shop entrance, and 0 otherwise.  Digging is an
# index used to get the difficulty of digging through this type of terrain.

# 'walk-msg' is the warning message for the player on stepping into damaging
# terrain

# 'run-msg' is the warning message for the player on running into damaging
# terrain

# 'hurt-msg' is the message the player gets when damaged by terrain

# 'die-msg' is the description if damaging terrain kills the player
# 'confused-msg' is the description of an attempt for a monster to move into
# non-passable terrain due to confusion

# 'look-prefix' is printed before the name in the result of looking at the
# terrain.  If not set, the default is to use 'an' if the name starts with
# a vowel or 'a' if the name does not start with a vowel.

# 'look-in-preposition' is the preposition that will be used when printing
# the result for an observer looking at the observer's grid:  'You are
# <preposition> <prefix> <name>'.  If not set, the default is to use 'on'.

# 'resist-flag' is the race flag a monster must have to be able to enter
# damaging terrain
