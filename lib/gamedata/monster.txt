# 'name' indicates the beginning of an entry.

# 'plural' is for plurals to monster names that can't be handled by normal
# pluralisation rules (see mon-desc.c for more detail).

# 'base' is for the monster base template (see monster_base.txt). This
# provides the default display symbol, some default flags, and the monster's
# pain messages.

# 'glyph' is for the display symbol. If present, this overrides the default
# display symbol from the base template.

# 'color' is for color. There are 28 colors, as follows:
# d - 0  - Black
# w - 1  - White
# s - 2  - Slate
# o - 3  - Orange
# r - 4  - Red
# g - 5  - Green
# b - 6  - Blue
# u - 7  - Umber
# D - 8  - Light Dark
# W - 9  - Light Slate
# P - 10 - Light Purple
# y - 11 - yellow
# R - 12 - Light Red
# G - 13 - Light Green
# B - 14 - Light Blue
# U - 15 - Light Umber
# p - 16 - Purple
# v - 17 - Violet
# t - 18 - Teal
# m - 19 - Mud
# Y - 20 - Light Yellow
# i - 21 - Magenta-Pink
# T - 22 - Light Teal
# V - 23 - Light Violet
# I - 24 - Light Pink
# M - 25 - Mustard
# z - 26 - Blue Slate
# Z - 27 - Deep Light Blue

# currently unused: d, M, t, T

# (note that "black" is the same color as the screen background, and thus the
# monster will appear to be an empty black space if its color is "d".)

# Note to maintainers/devteam: Light Violet (V) is currently used for the
# "purple uniques" option. The option makes all uniques appear in this colour
# (instead of only Castamir and Waldern). It is therefore unwise to use it
# for non-unique monsters.

# 'speed' is for speed; 110 is normal speed.

# 'hit-points' is the average number of hitpoints for this monster race, or the
# exact number for unique monsters.

# 'light' is for the light intensity generated by this monster; note that this
# can be positive, negative or zero (the default if there is no light line)

# 'hearing' is at what multiple of the player's vision radius the monster
# notices the player.

# 'armor-class' is a measure of how likely the player is to hit the monster;
# the player's hit chance is rolled against 2/3 of this value.

# 'sleepiness' is for initial monster sleep value. Sleepiness ranges from 0
# (ever vigilant for intruders) to 255 (prefers to ignore intruders).

# 'depth' is the monster's usual dungeon level

# 'rarity' is used for picking monsters to be generated; probability of a given
# monster race is 100/rarity

# 'experience' is the base experience for the monster; this is multiplied by 
# the monster depth and divided by the player level to get the number of
# experience points the player receives for killing the monster.

# 'blow' is for blows -- method of attack, effect of the attack, and damage from
# the attack.
# There may be up to four of these lines; effect and damage are optional.

# 'flags' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many flags:
# lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags are
# separated by the '|' symbol.

# 'flags-off' is for flags to remove from the template. For example, in
# monster_base.txt, molds are given HURT_FIRE. We don't want the red mold
# to have that, so we add a 'flags-off:HURT_FIRE' line to subtract that flag.

# 'innate-freq' is for frequency of innate ranged attacks - the number of
# monster turns, on average, before the monster will perform one of these
# attacks.  This must not be zero. If it is 1, the monster will never move
# while the player is in sight, and will thus never attack in melee, as it will
# use an innate attack every turn: if the monster is to use a melee attack,
# then X must be 2 or greater.

# 'spell-freq' is for spell frequency - the number of monster turns, on
# average, before the monster will cast one of its spells.  Similar
# considerations apply as for innate attack frequency.

# 'spell-power' is for the relative casting strength of a spellcasting monster.
# The default value is the same as the monster's depth (in which case no 
# 'spell-power' line is needed), so a monster with spell power greater than
# their depth is a particularly strong caster.
# Note that (apart from boulder throwers) monsters with only innate attacks
# but no spells a spell power value is not required.

# 'spells' is for spell flags, which work just like regular flags.

# 'desc' is for description. As many desc: lines may be used as are needed to
# describe the monster. Leading whitespace will be removed, and a single space
# will be added between desc: lines.

# 'drop' lines create possible drops for specific monsters. If any drop lines
# are present, the monster will drop *only* items from its drop lines.
# Each item has its percent chance rolled for individually.

# 'drop-base' lines work as for drops, but only the object tval is specified.

# 'friends' lines specify options for what monsters can appear with other
# monster on creation.  The format is:
# friends:Chance of friend appearing:number in xdy format:name of friend
#
# Note that number is throttled depending on the dungeon level with only half
# appearing at depth and the full complement 5 levels deeper.  All town friends
# will be divided by two.
# The code places monsters from bottom up and will not place it if it can't find
# room.  For best results, places the most important friends at the bottom.
# Using 'Same' as the name does what you would expect.
# Some friends can have special roles; these are appended to the line end.

# 'friends-base' lines work as for friends, but the name should be of a monster
# base, and any monster with that base can be chosen.

# 'mimic' lines give item types that this monster may mimic. Each of the objects
# has an equal chance of being mimicked.

# === Understanding monster.txt flags ===

# UNIQUE monsters are just "special" monster races, with the requirement that
# only one monster of that race can exist at a time, and when it is killed, it
# can never again be generated.

# ATTR_CLEAR monsters appear the same color as the floor, terrain feature or
# object underneath them.

# ATTR_MULTI monsters are multi-hued--they change color, every player turn.
# Their base color is only used to set the initial color when they spawn.

# ATTR_FLICKER monsters are also multi-hued--but they only change between a
# small range of colors related to their defined color, and they start out
# as their defined color.

# CHAR_CLEAR monsters are totally invisible: the symbol shown on the screen is
# the same as the floor (or other terrain feature) below it, or the item that
# is lying on that floor. These monsters can currently be targetted as normal
# monsters: perhaps this can be changed so that the player must KNOW the
# monster is there (by bumping into it, or having the monster wake up and
# attack the player?)

# CHAR_MULTI monsters are those which look like objects, and use the symbols of
# objects. They are in plain sight, but the character should not know that a
# monster is there. At the moment, such monsters can be targetted normally
# (which means that this flag currently has no effect), but this may change
# in the future, as with CHAR_CLEAR monsters.

# (Note that currently both CHAR_CLEAR and CHAR_MULTI monsters are treated as
# normal monsters that are just hard to see... if you (l)ook for them, you will
# find them unless they are invisible and you cannot see invisible, and if you
# use the * command for targetting mode you can pick them as a target.)

# TODO: Explain the other monster and spell flags. But maybe in another file.

desc:An even bigger monster of a hippo, it could be mistaken for a mountian
desc: but for its odd pinkish orange color. It rarely notices things as small
desc: as humans, but it could very easily step on you by accident with a foot
desc: that could flatten a town. Morgoth himself refuses to live deep enough
desc: to be among the giant behemoths.  BTW, the brain smashing is caused by
desc: a fart of titanic proportions.
